# 002_car_purchase_advisor_system ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

This is a source code of a program where the program helps recommend which car rental/car would be best for the user based on user preference such as car type &amp; time.

This time, it was my first time using OOP approach and it was challenging but also an valuable experience!

Please run main.py file and can also refer to the user_guide manual :)
